```
+add, -sub, *multiply, /divide, %modulus(gives reminder), **power
```

**Q. Swap value of two numerical variables without third variable.**

Ans : Perform addition and subtraction to one another to solve this problem.

## Conditionals 

Assignment 2 - [If-else-set-1-reactgram](https://onecompiler.com/challenges/42g4y9apv/if-else-set-1-reactgram)

```js
if (condition1) {
    // executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // executed if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

Q. Return absolute value of an integer
> remove the negativity thats it!

Q. Take 3 distinct integers a,b,c and return the integer of largest value.
> Check if one is greater than all if not check other var.

Q. Take 3 distinct integers a,b,c as input and return the second smallest among the input.
> Think about how you can compare each number to determine if it falls between the other two numbers. For instance, consider if a is the second smallest by checking if it is greater than one number and less than the other.
Use then || for second sequence!


Q. Vaid triangle
> Sum of all angles must be 180. 

| Type             | Side Lengths            | Angles                     |
|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Equilateral      | All sides are equal     | All angles are 60째         |
| Isosceles        | Two sides are equal     | Two angles are equal       |
| Scalene          | All sides are different | All angles are different   |
| Acute            | -                       | All angles < 90째           |
| Right            | -                       | One angle = 90째            |
| Obtuse           | -                       | One angle > 90째            |
