      I'm a Senior Application Engineer at VOIS with a strong foundation in full-stack development, particularly in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). I bring hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying scalable web applications. My skill set extends beyond codingâ€”I have solid expertise in Linux system administration, SQL databases, version control with Git, and general software engineering best practices.

I thrive in collaborative, fast-paced environments and take pride in building robust solutions that solve real-world problems. Whether it's optimizing back-end performance, crafting intuitive front-end interfaces, or managing deployments, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a dedication to continuous learning.
